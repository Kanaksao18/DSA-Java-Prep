🔶 2. Greedy Algorithms
❓ What is Greedy?
Greedy algorithms build up a solution step-by-step, always choosing the locally optimal option, hoping for a globally optimal solution.

✅ No backtracking or checking all possibilities
✅ Fast, often O(n log n) or O(n)
⚠️ Doesn't work if the problem lacks Greedy Choice Property
